                <h2>What is this?</h2>
                <p>The Whale Game is a gambling game on the Ethereum network. It uses smart contracts to create a fair and trust-less gambling environment for people to enjoy.</p>
                <p>The very basic principle of this game is a lot like a game of Jackpot in which players put their Ethereum into a pot (our smart contract) and at the end of a round a random winner is chosen.</p>
                <h2>What's in it for me?</h2>
                <p>Of every Ethereum entering the smart contract the winner takes home a total of 90%. So if there's 1 Ethereum total in the pot, you can take home 0.9 Ethereum.</p>
                <h2>What happens with the other 10%?</h2>
                <p>5% will be put into a second smart contract that will again draw a winner at the end of a year. Every participant gets one seat in this, no matter how much they put into this game over the course of a year.</p>
                <p>The remaining 5% will be kept as gambling fees by the owner of the smart contract.</p>
                <h2>Is this a scam?</h2>
                <p>No. The aim is to create a little passive income for the owner, while providing the players with a chance to win a quite substantial amount of Ethereum.</p>
                <h2>How do I participate?</h2>
                <p>All you have to do is to send a minimum amount of 0.01 Ethereum to the smart contract's adress. The adress can not yet be provided as the contract is still in beta testing. If you want to be kept up to date, we highly suggest to join our <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEmNEIqqpmv5DDPnfQ">Telegram broadcast channel</a> in which we'll push updates.</p>
                <p>Participation is absolutely anonymous and no registration is needed at any time. We think that a decentralized currency has no need for clear name registrations for a gambling game like this.</p>
                <h2>How can I see the amount of current players?</h2>
                <p>You can check the contract's adress on <a href="https://etherscan.io">Etherscan</a> or similar blockchain explorers to see how many people are currently in the game.</p>
                <p>In the future we will also provide a more comfortable overview of the game on this website.</p>
                <h2>How can I check if I won?</h2>
                <p>We will provide a small checkbox on this website once the game has started. With this you will be able to enter your Ethereum adress and the tool will check if you were the lucky winner or not.</p>
                <h2>Where can I find more information about this?</h2>
                <p>We will publish our whitepaper as soon as the game starts. In it you will find detailed explanation on how the smart contract operates.</p>
